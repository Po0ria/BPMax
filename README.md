"RNA-RNA interaction (RRI) is ubiquitous and has complex roles in the cellular functions. In human health studies, miRNA-target and lncRNAs are among an elite class of RRIs that have been extensively studied and shown to play significant roles in various diseases including cancer. Bacterial ncRNA-target and RNA interference are other classes of RRIs that have received significant attention. Accordingly, RRI bioinformatics tools tailored for those elite classes have been proposed in the last decade." [1] 

Computational models of RRI ( piRNA, BPMax, BPMaxW) are important but very expensive in time and memory space.

## What is Alphaz? 
[AlphaZ](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/AlphaZ/wiki/doku.php) is an open source tool-set for program analysis, transformation and parallelization in the Polyhedral Equational Model. It is being developed by the MeÃÅlange group at CSU, and uses an equational language called Alpha/Alphabets.
